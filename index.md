I am Ph.D. student at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/), a member of [Programming Languages Lab](https://pl.cs.pku.edu.cn/en/). I am advised by Prof. [Zhenjiang Hu](https://zhenjiang888.github.io/). My main interest is in programming languages, and type systems, formal semantics, program verification in particular. I am working on topics related to simplifying DSL and IDE implementation. Welcome to discuss with me!
